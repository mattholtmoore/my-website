            Hey, I'm Matt!

            I'm a fullstack developer with a passion for building cool websites
            and apps. I love to learn new technologies and apply them to

            Before that I worked at Elevation Church as a Worship Experience
            Director for 6 1/2 years. I grew up in (and currently live in)
            Louisburg, North Carolina - just 45 minutes north of Raleigh. Lived
            in Charlotte for almost 7 years. I'm a follower of Jesus, a husband
            to my beautiful wife Amanda, and father to my two amazing children,
            Koa Maverick and Jovie Mae. My favorite things to do are spend time
            with my family, travel, watch movies, write songs, sing, and play
            instruments. I'm a huge fan of Star Wars, Marvel, Harry Potter, and
            LOTR/The Hobbit. I love all genres of music but not all the same. I
            love the outdoors. I love to hike (though I have minimal
            experience), camp, and fish. And I really love the beach and the
            ocean. Anything else you want to know just ask!
