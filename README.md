## Description

This is a Nextjs / Notion API powered website to let you know who I am and how to connect with me. It is a small snippet into my life and work. You'll see an About that lets you know who I am and what I do. You'll also find other sections with links to a few of my recent projects, both for songs and software related projects. You'll see my contact information with links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, etc. accounts, as well as a form to input your name, email, and send me a personal message.
